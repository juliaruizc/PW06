# PW06

In this repository the code for the practical work number six can be found.

For the bonus stage a new method has been added called getConnection to implement the DriverManager class and not make it dependent of the SQLite class. To implement this method, some commentes have been added through the code under the sign "BONUS STAGE". This comments need to be uncommented and the ones related to the normal functioning of the code need to be commented in order to test it.

In the pom.xml file a dependency has been added as well is order for the test to work when the dependecy to the SQLite connector is commented. The appropriate scope for the SQLite connector dependency would be runtime.
